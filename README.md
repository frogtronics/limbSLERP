# limbSLERP
Code for performing the limbSLERP algorithm.  It is currently code for Mathematica (version 10 or higher).  Matlab code will be provided in future releases. Code files will be named filename_MM_version for Mathematica and filename_ML_version for Matlab.

For Mathematica Users:
limbSLERP requires the quatRotation package which you must install in your local system folder by the following steps:
1. Create a folder called "quatRotation" and place into it "quatRotation.m" 
2. Within this folder create two folders: "data" and "Kernel"
3. Place the "KM04_HOP_03_xyzPOINTS.dat" file into "data"
4. Place the "init.m" into "Kernel"
5. Your folder should have two subfolders and a file.
6. Locate the directory where Mathematica is stored locally.
7. Locate the Applications folder where the Packages are stored (if you're having trouble, see http://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/WolframSystemFileOrganization.html)
8. Drag the quatRotation folder into the Applications (or wherever your system stores mathematica packages).
